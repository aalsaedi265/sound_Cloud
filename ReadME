
makes app folder for django, main dir
django-admin startproject music_controller


## django-admin startapp api
inside music_controller

## django-admin startapp frontend
will handle the react stuff
staic for the stac bundles
templates for more dynamic stuff
src you know this

## npm init -y
sets up the front edn like npm init for react

## npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
installs Webpack and its CLI as development dependencies, which are essential for bundling and managing frontend assets

## BABLE   npm i @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --save-dev
allows js code interact with all web browser without conflict
this whole thing is configuration and making sure the front talks to the back, so think of it as really a lot of bolir plate code that must be here or nothing works
# babel.config.json
this optional, i was having a hard time and this help me over come it
# webpack.config.js 
transpile (bundle) everything. honestly just make create app it will be fast
i did it the out dated way

## scripts in package.json
 "dev": "webpack --mode development --watch",
 "build": "webpack --mode production"

 needed both to make or will have run this in frontend dir every time we want to activate react

## npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties
insures not coflicts occure later on with asyn & await trust me bro you want this


## front end stuff
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/core react react-dom --save-dev
npm install react-router-dom

init django database( less boiler plate code more fun code), you will see dn.sqlite3
py .\manage.py makemigrations
py .\manage.py migrate

backend server running
py .\manage.py runserver

py -m venv nameOfEnv
.\env\Scripts\activate


## WHY serlizers matter in API
converts complex data types ( querysets  model instances) into Python data types ( dictionaries) that can be rendered into JSON or XML, and vice versa


install everything you need all at once
pip install -r .\requirments.txt


django use obj relational mapper which adds a layer of obtraction to datanases
so we write py code and it interacts with the database makes life better
